The farm grows heirloom apples, two hundred and-fifty varieties of them that are rapidly disappearing from our modern food supply.

Run by two octogenarians, Phyllis and John Kilcherman maintain a showroom/tasting room in a huge barn that also displays John’s pop bottle collection, one of the largest in the country. On any given day you can see John buttoned into an apple collecting apron bringing more apples into the barn and Phyllis standing on the cold cement floor sharing one of her recipes with customers from near and far who visit this unique place in the Fall. 

The book features the family and the farm’s history beginning with its public offering by the U.S. Government in 1851. Color photos of the orchard in three seasons, photographed by Dianne Carroll Burdick, capture the living apple community from the bee’s pollination to apple harvest and all points of apple growing in-between. Phyllis shares recipes both traditional and creative uses of apples in meatloaf, coleslaw, baked beans as well as her most prized and sought after recipe from her grandmother, The Apple Pie.

The book is laced with folklore, poems, and the apple histories some of which go back to the Crimea peninsula of Russia. In fact, apples first got to the U.S. from their native Kazakhstan via Western Europe in the 17th century.

There were the proud, cultivated, and degenerate Sforzas in Milan, and in Rome, the corrupt Spanish family of the Borgia whose head, Rodrigo, ascended to St Peter's throne as Pope Alexander VI. In Florence, a golden age of culture and sophistication ended with the death of the greatest of the Medici family, Lorenzo the Magnificent, giving way to an era of uncertainty, cruelty, and religious fundamentalism.

In the midst of this turmoil, there existed the greatest concentration of artists that Europe has ever known. Influenced by the rediscovery of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, artists and thinkers such as Botticelli and da Vinci threw off the shackles of the Middle Ages to produce one of the most creative periods in history - the Renaissance.

This is the story of twelve years when war, plague, famine, and chaos made their mark on a volatile Italy, and when a young, erratic genius, Michelangelo Buonarroti, made his first great statue - the David. It was to become a symbol not only of the independence and defiance of the city of Florence but also of the tortured soul who created it.

The arrest in her sleepy northern California town kicked off what would become one of the most captivating murder trials in recent memory, as police, local attorneys, and the national media sought to unravel the complex web of events that sent this seemingly devoted housewife over the edge.

Now, with the exclusive access and in-depth reporting that made A Deadly Game a number one New York Times bestseller, Catherine Crier turns an analytical eye to the story of Susan Polk, delving into her past and examining how over twenty years of marriage culminated in murder. Tracing the family's history, Crier skillfully maneuvers the murky waters of the Polk's marriage, looking at the real story behind Susan, Felix, and their unorthodox courtship. When Susan was in high school, Felix, who was more than twenty years her senior, had been her psychologist, and it was during their sessions that the romantic entanglement began. From these troubling origins grew a difficult marriage, one which produced three healthy boys but also led to disturbing accusations of abuse from both spouses.

With extraordinary detail, Crier dissects this dangerous relationship between husband and wife, exposing their psychological motivations and the painful impact that these motivations had on their sons, Adam, Eli, and Gabriel. Drawing on sources from all sides of the case, Crier masterfully reconstructs the tumultuous chronology of the Polk family, telling the story of how Susan and Felix struggled to control their rambunctious sons and their disintegrating marriage in the years and months leading up to Felix's death.

But the history of the Polk family is only half the story. Here Crier also elucidates the methodical police work of the murder investigation, revealing never-before-seen photos and writings from the case file. In addition, she carefully scrutinizes the many twists and turns of the remarkable trial, exploring Susan's struggles with her defense attorneys and her shocking decision to represent herself.

Dark, psychological, and terrifying, Final Analysis is a harrowing look at the recesses of the human mind and the trauma that reveals them.","[""True Crime"",""Nonfiction"",""Crime"",""Mystery"",""History"",""Audiobook""]","1/1/2007","{""name"":""Catherine Crier"",""num_books"":10,""num_followers"":""95""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":31,""reviews_percentage"":6},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":53,""reviews_percentage"":11},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":177,""reviews_percentage"":37},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":131,""reviews_percentage"":27},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":83,""reviews_percentage"":17}}","""$4.99"""

Jordana Mendelson uses this ambiguity as a framework for the study of Spanish visual culture from 1929 to 1939―a decade marked, on the one hand, by dictatorship, civil war, and Franco’s rise to power and, on the other, by a surge in the production of documentaries of various types, from films and photographs to international exhibitions. Mendelson begins with an examination of El Pueblo Español, a model Spanish village featured at the 1929 International Exposition in Barcelona. She then discusses Buñuel’s and Dalí’s documentary films, relating them not only to French Surrealism but also to issues of rural tradition in the formation of regional and national identities. Her highly original book concludes with a discussion of the 1937 Spanish Pavilion, where Picasso’s famed painting of the Fascist bombing of a Basque town―Guernica―was exhibited along with monumental photomurals by Josep Renau. Based upon years of archival research, Mendelson’s book opens a new perspective on the cultural politics of a turbulent era in modern Spain. It explores the little-known yet rich intersection between avant-garde artists and government institutions. It shows as well the surprising extent to which Spanish modernity was fashioned through dialogue between the seemingly opposed fields of urban and rural, fine art, and mass culture.","","8/26/2005","{""name"":""Jordana Mendelson"",""num_books"":14,""num_followers"":""6""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":100}}",""

Their products and services make customers feel better. They create captivating products that energize the marketplace and set the standard for what customers want and expect. But this isn’t something you can add on after the fact. Your products and services must be built to love from the very start. This book tells you why and shows you how.

Peter Boatwright and Jonathan Cagan have worked with market-leading companies ranging from Fortune 100 corporations to niche firms in a variety of industries. They’ve found that for companies to form deep bonds with customers, emotions must be generated by a product itself—trying to associate emotions with a product simply through advertising is unreliable, expensive, and ultimately ineffective. They marshal stock market data that proves the bottom-line benefit of high-emotion products, as well as data showing that people are willing to pay more for products with emotionally rich features.

After demonstrating that authentic product emotion really does pay off, Boatwright and Cagan move on to how —how emotion can be broken down into its core building blocks, how it can then be used to develop new products and services, and how product touch points, in particular visual touch points, deliver those emotions. Emotion can be built into any product or service—a point vividly illustrated through case studies from a variety of industries.

Emotion is fundamental to all that is human, including the products we enjoy. Built to Love offers a clear method and a set of tools to help you gain loyal, even fanatical customers by going beyond mere efficiency and speaking to people’s deepest needs and wants.","[""Business""]","1/1/2010","{""name"":""Peter Boatwright"",""num_books"":7}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":2},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":14},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":12,""reviews_percentage"":35},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":11,""reviews_percentage"":32},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":14}}","""$27.95"""

This updated new edition contains additional examples and problems, and the chapter on relativistic mechanics of continua has been substantially rewritten.","[""Physics"",""Nonfiction"",""Science"",""Textbooks"",""Reference"",""Mathematics""]","8/19/1982","{""name"":""Wolfgang Rindler"",""num_books"":11,""num_followers"":""11""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":3},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":7,""reviews_percentage"":21},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":12,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":11,""reviews_percentage"":34}}",""

The Regulator Rebellion of 1766-71 pitted thousands of farmers, many of them religious radicals inspired by the Great Awakening, against political and economic elites who opposed the Regulators' proposed reforms. The conflict culminated on May 16, 1771, when a colonial militia defeated more than 2,000 armed farmers in a pitched battle near Hillsborough. At least 6,000 Regulators and sympathizers were forced to swear their allegiance to the government as the victorious troops undertook a punitive march through Regulator settlements. Seven farmers were hanged.

Using sources that include diaries, church minutes, legal papers, and the richly detailed accounts of the Regulators themselves, Marjoleine Kars delves deeply into the world and ideology of free rural colonists. She examines the rebellion's economic, religious, and political roots and explores its legacy in North Carolina and beyond. The compelling story of the Regulator Rebellion reveals just how sharply elite and popular notions of independence differed on the eve of the Revolution.","[""History"",""Nonfiction"",""American History""]","2/25/2002","{""name"":""Marjoleine Kars"",""num_books"":5,""num_followers"":""12""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":5},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":19,""reviews_percentage"":24},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":31,""reviews_percentage"":40},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":23,""reviews_percentage"":29}}","""$16.19"""

I have lived with a woman who was born in Bangkok for over three years and been married to her for two years. If it were not for my exposure to her and her family, I would now know how to survive in Bangkok ... but I would only have a superficial understanding of Thais and Thai culture.

Unlike some books written on relocating to Thailand, I don't think Thailand turns out to be a wonderful country for everyone. It works very well for me. And in this guide you will learn why.

More than anything, this guide is about Thai culture. If you are coming here from the USA it will be hard for you to overestimate how different Thai culture is from that in the USA. In the USA you have literally hundreds of religions. In Thailand, something like 95% of the population is Buddhist. Buddhism is reflected everywhere in Thai life. Many of the foreigners I meet who are confused by what they run into here on a day-to-day basis have not looked into Buddhism. In my opinion, if you don't have an appreciation for and understanding of Buddhism, you will not end up being comfortable with Thai culture and living in Thailand for any length of time.

I'm very happy living in Bangkok with my Thai wife. In this book I've tried to convey some of what that life is like … and to compare my quality of life here to what I experienced in the USA. Part of my motivation for writing the book is thinking that eventually something might happen to me while living here that will sour me on Thailand. At that point, I'll want something to remind me of why I chose to live here. So far, I'm still on my honeymoon. I don't think Thailand or Thai culture is perfect by any means. But, from my experience, the positives far outweigh the negatives.

To be very honest, there are many things about Thai culture and how Thais think that I just do not understand. For example, Thais are generally a very nonviolent people. Rather than kill stray or unwanted dogs, they abandon them at temples or leave them to fend for themselves on the street. But… I've been told by more than one person that hiring someone to kill a person who you want killed is not that difficult in Thailand. The strange part of all this is that it seems to be morally ok to have someone killed … but not morally acceptable to do it yourself.

Thailand is full of extreme contrasts and apparent contradictions. I've tried in this book to communicate some of this. For example, Bangkok is an adult Disneyland without brakes. If you have the money, you can buy most anything. But … the ones who get the most respect are the monks (even the King of Thailand shows a monk respect by waiing him). So, it's the ones who are able to turn their backs on all the worldly pleasures who are given the most respect.

If you come to live here you will gradually come to think you understand something about Thailand. But I think maybe the experience of living here will actually teach you more about the country you just left. All those things you took for granted for all those years start to seem like just one of many choices. For example, in the USA people usually consider their home to be a personal statement of who they are. Americans generally like to invite people to visit their home. Thais, on the other hand, usually meet friends at a restaurant to socialize. Thais are reluctant to invite friends to their home.

Those in charge of advertising Thailand to the world have chosen the phrase ""amazing Thailand"" to promote tourism. In my opinion, this is not false advertising. I hope my book can help prepare you for what you will find in Thailand…and to decide if it is really a good choice for you.","","5/4/2012","{""name"":""Alan Reeder-Camponi"",""num_books"":8,""num_followers"":""1""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":3},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":12},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":5,""reviews_percentage"":15},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":10,""reviews_percentage"":30},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":13,""reviews_percentage"":39}}","""$2.99"""

Après cinq années passées au loin et une nouvelle vie auprès d’une nouvelle compagne, Emmanuel Masson souhaite renouer avec son fils et, qui sait, peut-être le convaincre de venir vivre à Nice. Momo se laissera-t-il tenter ?C’est avec beaucoup de finesse que l’auteur, par le biais du prétexte agréable du voyage, nous présente une facette inconnue de la vie familiale de Momo. Non seulement Momo fait-il son premier voyage en avion, découvre-t-il la Côte d’Azur et l’accent du sud de la France, mais il devra aussi choisir sa destinée. Voici donc un roman qui allie à merveille émotion et humour et qui ravira les jeunes lecteurs de 7 ans et plus.À l’aube des vacances, Momo reçoit une invitation épatante. Aller rejoindre son père, qu’il n’a pas vu depuis cinq ans, à Nice où celui-ci possède un restaurant. Mais Momo n’a jamais voyagé seul et Lucie, sa mère, hésite à le laisser partir sans surveillance. Ses réticences tomberont rapidement lorsque M. Pacossi, leur célèbre voisin, peintre de profession, propose d’accompagner Momo pour son premier passage outre-Atlantique. Ainsi commence une folle équipée qui fait de ce périple une succession d’événements inattendus, à commencer par l’absence du père de Momo à l’aéroport. Momo ne se souvient plus du nom de famille de son père (il porte celui de sa mère) et il ne se rappelle plus le nom du restaurant. Nice est une grande ville. Comment s’y repérer? Heureusement, le hasard fait bien les choses et c’est par l’entremise de Brigitte, la nouvelle conjointe du père de Momo, qu’ils pourront enfin renouer connaissance. Momo découvre un environnement fort différent de Saint-Romain-des-Champs et où il serait bien tentant de vivre en permanence. Mais pourrait-il se passer de Lucie et de la belle Jessica Laliberté ?","","1/1/2003","{""name"":""BARCELO FRANCOIS"",""num_books"":18}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":1,""reviews_percentage"":20},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":4,""reviews_percentage"":80},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0}}","""$6.99"""

Goya simultaneously pursued a number of disparate projects, commissions he received from prestigious churches and royalty, as well as producing several lengthy series of lithographs to express his dislike of several subjects, notably Spanish high society and war. Brushing into controversy on several occasions, Goya threaded the political needle of alternating French and Spanish rule of his home country of Spain as well as successfully navigated the choppy waters of the Spanish Inquisition when it questioned the morality of La Maja Desnuda, one of his most famous paintings.","","11/19/2014","{""name"":""Sandra Forty"",""num_books"":86,""num_followers"":""5""}","{""1_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""2_stars"":{""reviews_num"":0,""reviews_percentage"":0},""3_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":37},""4_stars"":{""reviews_num"":3,""reviews_percentage"":37},""5_stars"":{""reviews_num"":2,""reviews_percentage"":25}}","""$5.99"""

Not the flask of opium-laced brandy she'd downed without realizing it's contents...  Jason York, the wicked Earl of St. Austell, can't quite forget the lady who stole his breath away the previous night. Of course, his broken nose, courtesy of the girl's brother, did have a way of making an impression.

Before the sun has risen the next day, Moira’s name and a scandalous wager have found themselves inside the infamous betting book at White’s.  One penniless gentleman after another begs Gideon Baxter, Viscount Ainsely, for his assistance in wooing Lady Moira. Unfortunately, Gideon would like to woo the charming lady himself.
